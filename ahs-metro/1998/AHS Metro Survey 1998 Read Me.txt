METROPOLITAN AREAS COVERED

Records in specific metropolitan areas can be identified by the value
of the SMSA variable, as follows:


SMSA    Frequency        Metro Area
-----------------------------------------
0720        4741    Baltimore
1000        5066    Birmingham

SURVEY DOCUMENTATION

The documentation for the American Housing Survey is still in flux.
The main code book for the 1998 metro survey is the "volume 3 code
book" which can be downloaded from the HUD USER site on the World Wide
Web, www.huduser.org.  However, this code book was designed for use
with the 1997 national survey.  Users of the metro survey will want to
consult the "volume 2 code book," also available online, and the "code
book for the American Housing Survey Data Base:  1973 to 1993," which
is available in paper form only.  All of these documents can be
ordered from HUD USER:

SAS "FILE FLATTENER" PROGRAM

The datasets supplied by HUD follow the pattern of the 1997 national
survey in that there are a number of separate files pertaining to
households, mortgages, persons, and so on.  The records in these files
can be related to one another by the combination of SMSA and CONTROL
values.  As a service to our users, HUD also provides a "file
flattener" program, IN_AHS_MS.SAS, which combines the separate file
into a single one, with one record for each housing unit.  Users of
statistical packages other than SAS can use the logic of this program
to write their own file flatteners, if desired.

ASCII VERSION

The main release of the 1998 Metro Survey data is in SAS format.  An
ASCII version is also available, in comma-and-quote delimited format.
They follow a format similar to the one used in the ASCII version of
the 1997 national survey dataset.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 1998 METRO SURVEY AND THE 1997 NATIONAL SURVEY

Certain files which were included in the 1997 national dataset are not
included in the 1998 metro dataset.  One dataset which was not in the
national dataset is in the metro dataset.

Common to both datasets:
houshld   General household and housing unit
mortg     Mortgages
owner     Manager & owner of rental units
person    Persons
rmov      Recent mover groups
toppuf    Recoded variables
weight    Sample weights

Not in metro survey:
homimp    Alterations & repairs
jtw       Journey to work

Not in national survey:
ratiov    See below

RATIOV DATASET

The variables in the RATIOV dataset are the responses to the question
shown below, about help that households receive with various expenses.
The question was asked of renter households with very high housing
cost- to- income ratios.  The ratio trigger depended on whether the
household was in subsidized housing. If subsidized, the trigger was 35
percent or more. If not, the trigger was 50 or more (and household
income also had to be less than or equal to $15,000). The households
eligible for the module were first checked to be sure we'd recorded
the proper amounts for rent and income. If so, we asked if they
received any other types of assistance that could account for their
high ratios.

"In these difficult economic times, many people have trouble making
ends meet.  Do you receive any EXTRA help from people or groups
outside the household to meet your monthly expenses, such as help with
-

MARK (X) ALL THAT APPLY"

RGROC     Food or groceries

RCLOT     Clothes

RCARP     Car or transportation expenses (include gas, car payments
tolls,
          public transportation)

RKIDC     Child care

RMEDI     Medical care or medicine

RUTIL     Utility bills

RCOST     The rent

ANOMALIES REPORT

The Bureau of the Census has supplied HUD with a report describing its
efforts to track down and fix a number of anomolies in the 1998 Metro
Survey data, as compared with earlier surveys.  This report is
available as a Microsoft Word file from the HUD USER web site.  Copies
may also be obtained by fax, mail, or email by contacting the person
listed at the beginning of this document.

AHS-MS 1998 CHANGES.DOC

This is a Microsoft Word file which details the changes in the dataset
since the August 11, 2000 release.

1998 FMRs.TXT

This is a text file which provides the HUD fair market rents (FMR), HUD-
Adjusted Median Household Income (HAMFI), and 4-Person Very Low Income
(VLI) cutoffs for the metro areas included in the dataset.  These official
HUD (not Census) numbers are often used by housing analysts.
