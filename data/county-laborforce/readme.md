Labor Force
=============

Cleaned data contains labor force information:

* total labor force 
* employed 
* unemployment 
* unemployment rate

Data is broken down by:

* Year (00-08)
* State
* County

In order to convert original files to .csv, I deleted rows 1-4, and 6. I also deleted column 6.  

Data downloaded from [LAUCountyData](http://www.bls.gov/lau/#tables).
