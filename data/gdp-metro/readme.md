Metropolitan GDP
================

Cleaned data set has information regarding large metropolitan areas. The data is broken down into industry subsets such as agriculture or manufacturing. The fips codes for this data set are not the standard state-county type. They specifically refer to only the large metropolitan area they were assigned. Also, each industrial subset has been assigned a number in the data. There are dictionaries for both. Also, there are many missing values in this data, especially for smaller metro areas and smaller industries.

Variables:

* Year (2001-2008)
* Industry (see indust-dictionary.csv)
* FIPS (see fips-dictionary.csv)
* GDP (in millions of current dollars)
