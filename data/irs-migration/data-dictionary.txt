OverviewCounty-to-County migration data flows are organized into two U.S. files of in-and out-migration flows, 51 state files of in-migration flows and 51 state files of out-migration flows, for a total of 102 files.  Migration flows have an origin and a destination, represented by the state and county of residence indicated on tax returns filed the first year (the origin) and the matching returns filed one year later (the destination).  The state and county origin is also referred to as being on the “from” side of the flow and the destination as being on the “to” side of the flow. The migration flows include the following county equivalents (Parishes in Louisiana, Boroughs and Census Areas in Alaska, independent cities, such as Baltimore, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. Flows into or out of the counties also include flows relating to foreign locations.  Endnote 1 provides further detail on the definition of foreign for the purposes of these tabulations.  The migration flows themselves consist of tabulations of three tax return variables: Number of Returns (1040s), Number of Exemptions, and Aggregate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) (in 1,000s).  B.  Characteristics of the Files    	ASCII language           Filenames:		countyinflow0708.dat (in-migration flows, all states)                       countyoutflow0708.dat (out-migration flows, all states)                Record length:	82 charactersC.  Records Included on the County In-Migration Flow File:	1.  The U.S. file contains all in-migration flows to all counties in the U.S.  Each state file is a subset of the U.S. file with only the in- migration flows to its respective counties.  All files include records of county level in-migration flows to each county from other counties in the U.S., from foreign countries1/, and for non-migrants.2/  2.  On the U.S. file only, the first five records are of the in-migration “Total Mig” flows tallied at the U.S. level from the following origins:        a.  Total of all in-migration flows from other counties           in the U.S. and from foreign.              b.  Total of all in-migration flows from other counties           in the U.S.              c.  Total of all in-migration flows from other counties           in same state in the U.S.              d.  Total of all in-migration flows from other counties           in different states in the U.S.       e. Total of all in-migration flows from foreign.3. State level summaries of the in-migration “Total Mig” flows from the origins listed in sections 2.a – 2.e. above are repeated on the U.S. and State files.                                                  4. The county level records that follow are sorted by the destination county FIPS3/ codes.  Each county is associated with a block of records having the following data:                a. County level summaries of the in-migration “Total Mig” flows from the             origins listed in sections 2.a – 2.e. above.                                                                                                           b. Total of non-migrants for each county.c. County-to-County in-migration flow records ranked by number of returns in descending order. Note:  The county-level “Total Mig” records are summed to the state level on the state files and to the U.S. level on the U.S. file.5. Data suppression is a more likely occurrence for county level data. Only those out-migration flows containing 10 or more returns are included.  The data are replaced with the value "-1" if they are based on less than 10 returns. Refer to Endnote 5 for information on data suppression and how it is handled in migration tabulations.D.

APO refers to Army Post Office and FPO refers to Fleet Post Office, part of the Overseas Military Mail System that is responsible for transferring mail to- and from- these overseas locations through military ZIP Codes.2/ The county-to-county non-migrant records have the same state and county at origin and destination.  3/ This is the Federal Information Processing Standard Codes.  The FIPS system is superseded by the American National Standards Institute Codes (ANSI) code system.  However, the State and County codes will remain the same.  Further information is available on the following Census web site: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/ansi/ansi.html or the ANSI web site: http://www.ansi.org/default.aspx4/ Postal and FIPS codes are not defined to cover the specialized tabulations in these files, therefore, we defined special postal- and FIPS-like codes to support the data summaries for these entities.  The codes are:                                  State      State    CountySummary                           Abbrev     Code     Code"Total Mig - US & For"         	US        96       000"Total Mig - US"               	US        97       000"Total Mig - Same St"          	US        97       001"Total Mig - Diff St"          	US        97       003"Total Mig - Foreign"          	US        98       000"Foreign - Overseas"           	FR        57       001"Foreign - Puerto Rico"        	FR        57       003"Foreign - APO/FPO ZIPs"       	FR        57       005"Foreign - Virgin Islands, U.S."    FR        57       007"Other Flows - Same State"     	SS        58       000"Other Flows - Diff State"     	DS        59       000"Other Flows - Northeast"      	DS        59       001"Other Flows - Midwest"        	DS        59       003"Other Flows - South"          	DS        59       005"Other Flows - West"           	DS        59       007"Foreign - Other flows"        	FR        57       0095/ Data SuppressionThe five Total summary records are included unless the data for these migration totals are suppressed if based on less than 10 tax returns.  The data are replaced with the value "-1". At the county level, the in- or out-migration flows from other counties that are based upon less than 10 returns are aggregated into seven Other Flow Summary geographic categories.  This summation maximizes the display of in- or out-migration data for each county in the county-to-county flow matrices.  These are the summary categories:      1.  Other county in-,/out-migration flows within the same state      2.  Other county in-,/out-migration flows from another state in the U.S.3. Other county in-,/out-migration flows from another state in the            Northeast Region of the U.S.4. Other county in-,/out-migration flows from another state in the          Midwest Region of the U.S.5. Other county in-,/out-migration flows from another state in the South           Region of the U.S.6. Other county in-,/out-migration flows from another state in the West           Region of the U.S.      7.  Other county in-,/out-migration flows from foreignIf the county in- or out- migration flows for any of the four Census regions are based on less than 10 returns, then none of the records for the four regions are included.  If the "other county in- or out-migration from foreign" category is based on less than 10 returns, then the records are not included.  If either of the "other county in- or out-migration flows within the same state" or "other county in- or out-migration flows from another state in the U.S." categories contain less than 10 returns, then both are excluded. This results in a variable number of in- and out-migration Other Flow Summary records included for each county, or there may be none.     In addition to the application of the suppression described above to the county in- and out-flow data, complementary suppression is also applied. It requires that one of the other small records be suppressed.  The additional suppression prevents the re-derivation of suppressed data from the totals.
