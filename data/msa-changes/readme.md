Metropolitan statistical areas
==============================

A metropolitan statistical area is a collection of counties that encompass an urban centre of at least 50,000 people.

This dataset provides a mapping from MSA name to msa code for 2003-2008.  MSA names can change on a yearly basis.

Unfortunately there is no easy way to match historical MSAs with current MSAs because prior to 2003 a completely different numbering standard was used.  It may be possible to connect the two sets based on the counties that compose each MSA.
