Tourism Predictor from the GDP metro data
=========================================
by Garrett Grolemund

This was an initial attempt to identify a variable that could be used as a vacation destination indicator for cities.  The gdp data in question seemed incomplete and to contain data entry errors.  I abandoned this line of query nd instead examined the CPS data set as documented in the CPS folder.

Caution
=======
I suspect the code contains errors when matching up msa codes.  I've since expanded an updated the database I was using, but I did not update the code here.
