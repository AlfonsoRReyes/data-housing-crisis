1. Mapping-data
============
by Garrett Grolemund

I combined the HPI data with latitude and longitude data to explore the spatial component of the housing crisis.

Conclusions
===========
* House prices first started falling around Detroit and Michigan in 2005. This drop doesn't appear to be bubble related because those prices did not first go up (to my knowledge). Some California cities also peaked in 2005.  Perhaps these are where the bubble truly began? The next wave of house prices peaked along the coasts. Florida, California, Arizona, and New England expreienced their peaks in 2006 and then 2007. Most of the interior has not yet had a peak/fall.  The map suggests that we have not experienced a nationwide housing crisis, but instead multiple, geographically distinct crises.  The map does not explain how these crises may be related.

* The largest drops have occurred almost exclusively in California, Florida, and Arizona. Although Michigan house prices have been falling for the longest amount of time, their total drop appears to be near the national average. The areas with the largest drops almost all peaked in 2006 (or 2005 for some California cities).  However, not every area that peaked in 2006 experienced a large price drop. Towns in New England and Michigan that peaked during this time experienced a much smaller retracement.

* Looking at rates shows that the large drops in California, Arizona, and Florida are not just the result of their prices peaking earlier and having a longer time to fall. When adjusted for time ,the price drops still far exceed the national average.

* The rate map shows a possible "second wave" of the housing bubble. Many towns that experienced their peak only recently (2008) show a larger than average rate of price drop. These towns are mostly in the Sunbelt and the interior of New England with a few on the northwest coast. It will be interesting to follow up on these towns.  Again, the interior of the country appears largely unaffected.

* With this map we appear to see the bubble as it burst.  The first tears were in the San Francisco Bay Area and the small, swank towns just north of LA.  There's no reason to believe the causes of the bubble are particularly revealed in these places. But perhaps they could reveal information about what a bubble looks like right before it bursts?


2. HPI OUtcomes by State
=========================
by Garrett Grolemund

I noticed that the relationship between a CBSA's maximum HPI and the rate of its price drop (as a percentage of the max HPI) seemed negatively correlated with a nearly linear relationship. I further analyzed this relationship by state.

Observations
=============
* When all CBSA's are plotted a strong negative relationship exists between the maximum HPI acheived at the peak of the bubble and the subsequent rate of decline (as a percentage of this peak). This measure of price drop is standardized for both the amount of time the price has been dropping and the maximum HPI value.

* Many CBSA's in the united states had not experienced any decline in HPI as of 2009, quarter 1.

* No CBSA that acheived an HPI above 250 was able to sustain it (a price drop occurred).

* Price drops at a rate greater than 10 percent per year occured almost exclusively in Florida and California.

* California behaves very differently than the other states that experienced a bubble: Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon all display a tight linear relationship between drop rate and maxhpi.  California is all over the place - a point cloud.

* NV has a much steeper relationship than the other states examined.

* When California cities are labeled according to the region the state comes from the negative relationship observed in other states is observed within each California region.  Moreover the regions have little overlap.  California appears to behave as two or three separate states: The Bay Area, Southern California, and the Central Valley.

* The metropolitan areas of California behave similar to the agricultural areas, but appear to naturally sustain higher HPI levels. 

* A line plot of HPIs over time also seems to show this.
