Second Homes Exploration/Renters
=========================
by Garrett Grolemund

I examined the ACS data to identify areas with a high percentage of vacation homes. VACS = s denotes homes that are not the owners' primary residence and are used mainly for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use only. This would make a simple matter of things, but on the survey, entries in the VACS column appear to only have 1 response: NA.

As an alternative measure, I examined the tenure variable, TEN. Values of 1 and 2 identify the house as owner occupied. Values of b,3, and 4 denote houses that are not owner occupied.  To be owner occupied, the house must be the primary residence of the owner/mortgage holder. A second home will be marked as not owner occupied even if the home owner is living there at the time of the survey (because it is not his primary residence). As seen below, this method appears to be identifying renters instead of second or vacation homes. However, there may be a more direct way to pull renter information from the ACS data.

The ACS increased its sample size in 2005. The increase was spread among states in a non-uniform manner. California, Florida, Texas, and New York received the greatest numbers of additional sample households. Perhaps this suggests that these states were growing the fastest at that time.

Observations
============

* In most states, owner occupancy ranges between 70% and 80%.  No state has an owner occupancy ratio noticeably greater than 80%.

* Only Washington D.C., Hawaii, California, New York, Nevada, and Alaska had owner occupancy rates below 70%. Washington D.C. was the only area with an owner occupancy rate below 60% (it is approximately 50%).

* The within state rates of owner occupancy fluctuate between 2000 and 2007. Wisconsin had the greatest increase of 8%, Alaska had the greates decrease of 4%.

* California, Florida, Nevada, and New York have all had a decrease in owner occupancy that began in 2004 and continued through 2007. This is not true of all states. (note: this may be partly a result of the change in sample size that occurred between 2004 and 2005).

* The percent of second homes fluctuates among pumas.  The highest rates occur in and near downtown Miami (4009, 4010) (>60%) and downtown Orlando (2204) (>50%). This and the state level observations imply that our measure of second homes measures rental properties, such as apartments, more than vacation homes.


Conclusions
============

* Owner occupancy seems to identify rented properties instead of vacation properties

* A PUMA's owner occupancy rate had no observable relationship to the PUMA's maximum HPI during the crisis, the time the PUMA acheived this peak in HPIs or the rate at which the HPI subsequently fell.
