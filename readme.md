The number of houisng unites in 2000 is from the 2000 census. For ever year after, the estimate was based on July 1st of that year. For a definition of housing unit, please see "Terms" below.  

* **Census Population:** Data set is also from the U.S. Census. Cleaned data set contains information regarding population for U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA). Has information such as population estimate, deaths, births, and migration. The data covers years 2001-2008. For a definition of CBSA, please see "Terms" below.  

* **Cenus QuickFacts:** Data set contains basic demographic and geographical information. It includes information for all states and counties, and cities with more than 25,000 people.  

* **City Location:** The clean data set contains information for all major cities for every state. It includes longitude and latitude, and the multiple location codes used throughout the data set. Please see “Terms” for the list and definition of the different types of locations used.  

* **Construction Housing Units:** This information was taken from the U.S. census. It records new residential construction in Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The data is collected monthly and covers years 2000 through 2009.

**How does the HPI differ from the S&P/Case-Shiller® Home Price indexes?**

Although both indexes employ the same fundamental repeat-valuations approach, there are a number of data and methodology differences. Among the dissimilarities:**

a. The S&P/Case-Shiller indexes only use purchase prices in index calibration, while the all-transactions HPI also includes refinance appraisals. FHFA’s purchase only series is restricted to purchase prices, as are the S&P/Case-Shiller indexes.

b. FHFA’s valuation data are derived from conforming, conventional mortgages provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The S&P/Case-Shiller indexes use information obtained from county assessor and recorder offices.

c. The S&P/Case-Shiller indexes are value-weighted, meaning that price trends for more expensive homes have greater influence on estimated price changes than other homes. FHFA’s index weights price trends equally for all properties.

d. The geographic coverage of the indexes differs. The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, for example, does not have valuation data from 13 states. FHFA’s U.S. index is calculated using data from all states.

For details concerning these and other differences, consult the [HPI Technical Description](http:**//www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/896/hpi_tech.pdf) and the [S&P/Case-Shiller methodology materials](http:**//www.macromarkets.com/csi_housing/documents/tech_discussion.pdf)
